# Alien Attack

This is a 3rd year team university project created with Unity. This is a tower defence game with a unique enemy path system. Instead of having the enemy follow a specific path, the player created walls/barriers by purching them and placing it on the map. Enemmies will then have to travel around these obstacles.
